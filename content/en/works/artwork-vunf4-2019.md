*V.[u]nf_4* addresses the subject of violence in Mexico from the citizen’s perspective<!--more-->, as it is part of a larger research-creation project: *Vis. [un]necessary force*. In Mexico authorities admitted that nearly 62,000 people had “vanished since the start of its catastrophic war on drugs in 2006.” (Phillips, 2020) *V.[u]nf_4* presents a corpus of sounds taken from the activities of Las Rastreadoras de El Fuerte, or Trackers of El Fuerte, a group of civilians, mostly women, that search in the desert for clandestine graves, in the outskirts of Los Mochis, in the northern state of Sinaloa, in Mexico. Noises come from recordings made during one of the journeys of Las Rastreadoras (February 2019). The strata of sounds of *V.[u]nf_4* allude to different moments of this expedition. Rastreadoras’ voices through their daily interaction, their steps on the ground, and the sounds of their main activity: to dig in the open field to try to find the remains of their loved ones, victims of forced disappearance.
