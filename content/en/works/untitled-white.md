Untitled [White] provides an enclosed environment for the individual camouflaged within its structure yet able to maintain awareness of the space outside. Constructed as a circle the structure literally wraps the viewer in light. This piece is not only interested in the physical space but the audible space as well. This is realized in the sound that emanates from the electricity that runs through the neon lights encapsulating the space, and the visitor, with sound.
