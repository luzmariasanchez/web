Spurs vs Pistons consists on the sound recording of one of the games between this two basketball teams, in San Antonio, Texas. The score is presented through screens in the arena. Acoustically, what we have is only the reactions of the public and the sound of the animator through its keyboard. The original recording of the match was edited to the shortest piece meaning. All this small sound bites are then played randomly into a never-ending match.
