Home Land Security

2487
Exhibition

Occupying a suite of former military structures in the Presidio overlooking the San Francisco Bay, Home Land Security brought together works by contemporary artists and collectives from around the globe to reflect on the human dimensions and increasing complexity of national security, including the physical and psychological borders we create, protect, and cross in its name.

Invited artists:   Shiva Ahmadi, Tammam Azzam, Tirtzah Bassel. Díaz Lewis, Yashar Azar Emdadian, Al Farrow, Liza Lou, Mandana Moghaddam, Trevor Paglen, Shahpour Pouyan, Michele Pred, The Propeller Group, Luz María Sánchez, Do Ho Suh, Bill Viola, Alexia Webster, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Yin Xiuzhen.

2487 On-site eight-channel sound installation

The number that provides the title for Luz María Sánchez’s sound installation in Battery Marcus Miller represents a disturbing tally, an attempt at quantifying the individuals who lost their lives crossing the United States−Mexico border between 1993 and 2006. Sánchez gives voice to those who can no longer speak by recording the name of each known decedent as a single sound file and allowing the collection to play at random — a continuous stream of sound emanating from different points in the space, alternately overlapping and punctuated by moments of silence.

The sequence never repeats exactly, the rhythm never becomes predictable, echoing the uncertain terrain traversed in the Mexican diaspora, as well as the “elements of chance” that can have such profound impacts on migrant journeys. The effect is both hypnotic and chilling, lulling visitors with the poetry of the artist’s voice even as the piece underscores the tragedy of these deaths — whose actual total number is unknowable.
