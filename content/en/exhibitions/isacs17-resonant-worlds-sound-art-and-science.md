ISACS17 (re)investigates the  intersections of sound, art and science from the perspective of artistic / creative curation. The participants are asked to showcase, and reflect on, their own practices from the perspective of how and why choices are made in order to make things »work« – in the sense that it resonates in/with other people, contexts, culture, society, history, and »the world«. These are perhaps issues of (and effects from) embodied experiences, of language games, of existence.

Sound may reveal the hidden ontologies of things »out there« in the ‘resonant world’, which both art and science are aiming to describe and understand. It is a field which has seen much activity within post-humanism, post-phenomenology and post-positivism. However, these discourses seem far removed from the production and practice of art, where hard choices are made and decisions taken that frame how it embody experience; as well as how it may resonate with other things that »exist« in the world.

This conference seeks to enter into the grey zone(s) of where the production of that »resonance» takes place, through dialogues with people working there; asking some crucial questions about when and in what way the intersections of sound, art and science »works out« – is it based on subjective judgment calls, language games, contextual framings? Do works that ‘work well’ have a resonating quality (embodied, existential, cultural etc?) that we all share, or is the experience of resonance a matter of individual tastes etc?

We have invited keynotes and accepted papers based on double blind review-process, which all question or experiment with the academic format, such as curator-based research, performative academics, audio papers, and a variety of practice-based formats.
