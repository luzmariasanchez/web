In this book the author presents a primarily auditory, sonorous Beckett. This volume concentrates on the corpus of works that Samuel Beckett wrote for radio between 1956 and 1961, reviews them in depth, analyzes them and places them in the context of his work for electronic media. The author turns to the vast literature in English on the subject of sound technologies, electronic art, also that which devotes her attention to the work that Beckett produces in the recording studios of the British Broadasting Corporation and Radio Télévision Frangaise from 1957 to the mid-1970s, as well as Everett C. Frost's production on American public radio in the late 1980s. Sánchez Cardona also integrates to this corpus coding those texts conceived for other languages ​​and which found one of their last forms in sound production. Far from being considered marginal constructs, the six works for the radiophonic medium that are analyzed in this document have been recognized as fundamental in the formulation of a corpus in which the possibilities of the voice, split from the emitting source -thank you to sound technologies-, see a point of no return for all of Beckett's work from 1962. Hence the relevance of this approach.
