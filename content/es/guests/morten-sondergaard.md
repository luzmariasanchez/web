My research is centered on Media Art as transdisciplinary practice, and its histories and ontologies. From this basis, I am focusing on unheard avant-gardes (experiments in media art) (especially from Scandinavia in the 1960s) and the founding, geneology and use of the metaphors of 'media art', 'art and technology', 'art and science' etc. I am (re)tracing and (re)investigating the works/experiments and the way they are / were documented, looking at and discussing how their ontological status may best be revisited today (and in the future). Especially, I am looking at sonic expressions in art and sound as evidential material in archives and alternative histories. The politics and ethics of metaphors in the cultural heritage field in general.
