Untitled [Nuweiba Radio Frequencies] is comprised of sounds recorded from various Arab radio stations in the Gulf of Aqaba, Egypt during the last two weeks of March and the first week of April in 2003—the presumed end of the US war against Iraq. As seen in these festival installation shots, this piece was included at “Zeppelin” 7th Sound Art Festival, Others’ sounds – > others’ reasons, Sound psychogeographies, sponsored by the Centro de Cultura Contemporánea de Barcelona, and presented in both Barcelona and Zaragoza, Spain.
