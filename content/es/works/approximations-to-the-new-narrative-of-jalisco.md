A lot has been heard about the new narrative. While some writers are emerging on the national and world literary scene, in Jalisco the new writers work 24 hours a day, but do we know them? Do we know what opinion the world, the city, the city deserve. literature?

Luz María Sánchez (1971) approached the literary interview from two essential sides: academia and creative activity and interviewed seven young Jalisco storytellers: José Israel Carranza, Bernardo Esquinca, David Izazaga, Fernando de León, Mauricio Montiel, Eugenio Partida and Luis Martín Ulloa.

Of Approaches to the new Jalisco narrative, Emmanuel Carballo has said: "" ... is inscribed in the current of the literary interview. In it, the author interviews seven Jalisco narrators born around 1970 and who make up a promising present for the letters of Jalisco. Luz María Sánchez interviews them in depth, seeks and manages to establish a common denominator between the seven and, finally, organizes a strict anthology of these brand-new prose writers. The book is useful for Jalisco literature and is a preview of what other literary researchers can do "". http://www.elem.mx/obra/datos/216349
