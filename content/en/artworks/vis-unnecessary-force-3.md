Vis. [un]necessary force_3 or under its acronym V.[u]nf_3, addresses one of the most alarming issues in Mexico: the abduction of young individuals, mostly male, ages 18 to 30, often with the complicity of police/military forces. In 2019 numbers escalated to +60,000 forced-disappearance registered cases. Due to the lack of action of the local/federal authorities, citizens have been organizing themselves to perform independent investigations and on-site searches for their abducted family members. Threatened by cartels and police/military forces alike, these citizens are the only ones that – organized in small groups – are looking for forced-disappearance victims nation-wide.

V.[u]nf_3 is an artistic-social project developed for communities that search for their family members, victims of forced-disappearance. It consists of a collaborative and participatory audio-visual cyber-cartography for mobile systems and a data-visualization website. And materialises as a tool + online-space created for documenting expeditions of individuals – embedded in close- knitted communities – looking for clandestine graves. The app registers text, audio, video, and geo-locates data. The website is the archive, visualising, and systematising data recorded: private histories that, altogether, construct the chronicles of the whole community.

V. [u]nf_3 is a tool explicitly designed for Mexican trackers of clandestine graves. The preliminary functional model, was made after the activities of Las Rastreadoras de El Fuerte [Trackers from El Fuerte], a community – predominately made of women – that since 2014 and under the guidance of Mirna Medina, have been searching for graves around the city of Los Mochis, in the northern state of Sinaloa.

V. [u]nf_3 allows for reinforcing citizen-empowerment through the building of an individual + collective data-cartography; strengthening the community through the shared experience of
reviewing and analyzing outcomes from data-recollection; breaking the digital exclusion through learning-while-using the app + website; experiencing a bespoke social software made for the specificity of their search practices; creating an expedition-archive through this user-generated content + metadata tool; building resistance against oblivion and neglect while constructing a digital-memorial that will honour their loved ones when registering their histories.
