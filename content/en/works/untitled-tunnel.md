The spectator faces a moving image of an endless tunnel. The video image is comprised of a 30-second loop based upon just three seconds of footage shot in a city tunnel in Guadalajara. The sound, produced in the studio, intimates someone running the effect enhanced with the sound of repetitive heartbeats. Creating mixed emotions of distress and excitement, the sensation of enclosure and entrapment is enduring in this piece.
