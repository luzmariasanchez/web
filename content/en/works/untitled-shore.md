This structure was made during a residency in Egypt. It was installed on the South Sinai shore in the Gulf of Aqaba during the last week of March and the first week of April 2003—the climatic moment of the US invasion of Iraq. Positioned at a point of contention, the “bunker” faced the Saudi Arabian mountains across the Red Sea beyond which the war was taking place. Without the use of technological or mechanical aids, the piece is experiential oriented to the surrounding elements. To experience this work the visitor must crouch down in the sand and crawl inside and through, to the end of the twenty-six foot long structure. Deep inside, one will find a small aperture focusing out over the Red Sea into Saudi Arabia. Within the “bunker” the elements are animated and amplified as the visitor watches and listens to the sea, the wind, the sand, et al., from the protection of this bunker.
