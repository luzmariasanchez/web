"LASER TALKS MEX will be the first initiative of its kind in Mexico -and in a Spanish-speaking country-. Produced by the Autonomous Metropolitan University [UAM] within the framework of the Arts, Sciences, Humanities and Citizenship [ACHC] project.

Free and open to the public, LASER TALKS MEX seeks to open a node for discussion and dialogue, in which specialists, creators, and the general public find a platform for exchanging knowledge about science and arts within the territory of Mexico City."
