V.[u]nf_2 explores the consequences of violence in everyday life, specifically in children orphaned by violence in Mexico. The final installation consists of up to 50 sound sculptures printed in 3D (additive sculptures) made from the creative interaction with the children participating in the project.

The creative interaction takes place in a therapeutic environment under the professional practice of the psychologist Ver√≥nica Castillo Arnal, specialized in taking care of infants with post-traumatic stress in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.

V.[u]nf_2 are a series of additive or 3D print sound sculptures that emerge from and reintroduce themselves in a therapeutic context.
