SINSONTE Is a Collaborative Socially-Engaged Sonic Art Project. Conceived and produced specifically for South of San Antonio. That uses digital technology to engage communities in the [re]discovery and [re]construction of their surroundings.


Has three fundamental components:

(1) the environment


[the landscape, soundscape, the ecological, the surroundings]
 

(2) the social

 
[community-based, social-engagement, education]
 

(3) the technological


[sound (re)construction, geo-localization, archive, mobile application]
 

 Explores concepts of acoustic ecology and sound practices; employs digital technology for data recording and data transmission; and develops a strong educational and community-based approach.

 
In order to facilitate participants [re]cognizing and [re]constructing their surrounding individuals within a community are invited to engage in a series of outdoor activities —sound walking, deep listening, and field recording.


Using their personal hardware as recording gear mobile phones as sound recorders— and a dedicated app designed specifically for this project.


Wandering through specific urban or rural areas, participants record sounds they find stimulating and thought-provoking.


Participants are invited to discover the sonic pulse of their surrounding-space while listening to a final mix of individualized micro-soundscapes.


The application is just 30% of the community-engaged art Project, the 70% consists of educational, community-engaged activities.
