Multimedia participatory installation.

9 additive (3D) sculptures, drawings, prints.\
Dimensions: variable.\
Duration: undetermined.\

V.[u]nf_2 explores the consequences of violence in everyday life, specifically in children orphaned by violence in Mexico. The final installation consists of up to 9 sculptures printed in 3D (additive sculptures) made from the creative interaction with the children participating in the project.

The creative interaction takes place in a therapeutic environment under the professional practice of the psychologist Ver√≥nica Castillo Arnal, specialized in taking care of infants with post-traumatic stress in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.

V.[u]nf_2 are a series of additive or 3D print sound sculptures that emerge from and reintroduce themselves in a therapeutic context.
