Detritus is an audiovisual installation by Luz María Sánchez that presents raw data on the 2006-2012 war against drug trafficking in Mexico and its devastating results among civilians. Detritus consist on a large-scale projection of more than 10,862 digital images taken from Mexican national electronic media over the period of 12.11.06-11.30.12. Images are intervened, and then projected in a double large-scale screen, in random sequence, each during a 2 second lapse. The sound component come from a 6 channel installation that captures the violence on the US-MX border employing recordings from police radio frequencies, taken on site in 2005. There is no narrative, but a constant flow of images and sound. There is also a printed database with information related to the media sources. During the last 6 years, Mexican President declared war against drug trafficking. Since then, there have been at least 60,000 civilians dead. Media has been portraying details on this account, cooperating with the normalization of violence as part of the new reality. “Detritus addresses the problem of the disturbance and disruption of the realism of news (either photographs or sound recordings), and the impossibility of understanding the phenomenon of everyday violence within the Mexican society. (…) There is a sense of the impossibility of really comprehending this phenomenon, the impossibility of dealing with it intellectually or emotionally, and the horror of the constancy of death and disfigurement and torture”. Toby Miller.
