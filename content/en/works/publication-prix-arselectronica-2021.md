**JURY ARS ELECTRONICA 2021 / Sound Art and Digital Musics**

“The jury is strongly drawn to this very simple, very strong sound installation. The immersive experience that deals with extreme violence in Mexico has an immediate impact and elicits an emotional response. There are no crying faces, no horrible stories, just the sound of people talking, the sound of sand, tools, walking. And slowly you realize that these people are not on a happy Sunday walk, they have dedicated themselves to finding the graves of missing people in the desert of Mexico. Awareness is achieved by a very simple means and you can’t shake it off.”	 (Stocker, 2021: 142-143)
