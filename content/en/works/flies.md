Flies is an audio CD sound piece, produced in multiple. The work is comprised of audio takes of fruit flies edited together without any digital manipulation. Recorded in Oxfordshire’s Braziers Park in the UK, this project isolates the sound of the fly in repetition. Each track is a loop and meant to be played for an indefinite duration.
