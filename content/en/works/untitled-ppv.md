During a three month art residency offered by the Círculo de Bellas Artes de Madrid, sound and video recordings were made throughout the Basque Country. The sound recordings were edited as part of a sound bank to be used in the media lab at ARTELEKU. The second phase of this project was been enacted in which several sound artists were invited by Xabier Erkizia (Arteleku Audiolab) to create new sound works using this sound recordings: RE MAPA. A third project followed up later, giving place to an interactive sound map of the Basque Country (www.soinumapa.net).
