REA-Mexico is a non-profit organization that represents and promotes Acoustic Ecology in Mexico, in connection with the World Forum on Acoustic Ecology (WFAE).

It is a space where all those academics, professionals, creators, students, institutions, companies and organizations in general that have to do in some way with Acoustic Ecology in Mexico and in the world can be integrated, making room for any of its manifestations, as well as to any of the disciplines that are cultivating, promoting or studying it, in order to promote the multidisciplinary development of Acoustic Ecology in Mexico.

We promote an active, purposeful and creative participation of the acoustic community; where courses, congresses, contests, prizes, exhibitions, publications and other possibilities of the same nature related to Acoustic Ecology can be convened, either within the country or abroad.
