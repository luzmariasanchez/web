Reference text, aimed especially at those who are interested in knowing cases in which sound has been used as an artistic tool throughout the 20th century. Luz María Sánchez Cardona presents an approximation text, an instrument approach to those points –selected from a much larger corpus–, where the presence of sound intervened by machines can be appreciated –at the end of the 19th century - and up to the decade from the seventies of the twentieth century.
