This sound installation captures the swelling aggression on the US-Mexico border region employing sound generated by radio frequencies used by the Nuevo Laredo police. Nuevo Laredo is a border city opposite its twin, Laredo, Texas, on the other side of the Rio Grande in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. Sampled together are recent and pre-recorded recordings of activity registered on the regional police frequencies. The main sound sample that is the focal point of the piece transcribes a fight between the Nuevo Laredo police and a criminal group not identified.
