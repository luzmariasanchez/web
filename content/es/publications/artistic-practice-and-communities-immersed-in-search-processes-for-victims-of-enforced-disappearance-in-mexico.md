Chapter in book: Forms of resistance: Seven experiences of listening and protest in artistic practices. This work compiles seven Latin American experiences on the incidence of artistic practices in the context of extreme violence in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. Violence configured by the States and by their absence, challenged from creation, collective testimony, the performative act, listening, virtuality, cultural management and art therapy. These perspectives cohabit the space of doing in art and the exploration of violence and its actors.
